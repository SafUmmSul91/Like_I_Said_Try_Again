View the live project [here](https://safummsul91.github.io/Like_I_Said_Try_Again/)

This is a Portfolio website I created for my Milestone Project with Code Institute. It is mostly responsive and easy to navigate on different devices.

I created this README.md file using the Code Institute template.

# User Experience (UX)
## User stories
### First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the person the portfolio belongs to, and to be able to navigate through the site to find the content I may need e.g testimonials, social media links, past and upcoming projects.
Returning Visitor Goals
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the person with any questions I may have.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.
Frequent User Goals
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added projects or updates.

# Design
Colour Scheme

The "Brand" Colours I chose are:
*RICH BLACK FOGRA 29 #071013
*SILVER SAND #B8C0CA
*PEWTER BLUE #75ABBC
*PALE PINK #FAD4D8

and where found using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
I chose these colours because I thought them modern and fun espcially paired with the font.

# Typography

I chose [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=The%20quick%20fox%20jumped%20over%20the%20lazy%20brown%20dog.&preview.text_type=custom&category=Serif,Sans+Serif&sort=popularity) and [Jura](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jura?preview.text=The%20quick%20fox%20jumped%20over%20the%20lazy%20brown%20dog.&preview.text_type=custom&category=Serif,Sans+Serif&sort=popularity) 

Monterrat being used for the main body of text and Jura used for Headings, Subheadings, these two fonts were chosen because they are clean and modern and switch up the monotony. They are also easy to read. Sans Serif will be the fallback font in casse they aren't being imported correctly.

# Imagery

I didn't use much imigary in this project, it is quite minimal and straight forward.
The Here Image is the SRM logo that I created using [camva](https://canva.com) it is simple but effective.
The Avatar of the woman in headscarf I also found on [canva](https://canva.com) and edited it to suit the colour scheme.

## First-Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand what the site is and learn more about the owner of the portfolio.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
The text on the landing page work with the hero image and call to action buttons invite the user to fiind out more.
The user can click the call to action buttons or use the Navbar, both will go to the same place, to learn more from the website.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.
The C.V. is easy to both read and download

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. 
The Nav bar is found at the top pf each page and each link describes what the page they will be clearly.
There is a contact form at the end of each page encouring user to get in touch.
On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
Small simple social media links are found down first on Lnading page and then in footer of each page should user wish to find out more.

## Returning Visitor Goals
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the owner with any questions I may have.
The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact" Page.
Here they can fill out the form on the page or use the contact information provided.
They can message the owner on their social media.
The footer contains links to the organisations Github, Pinterest and Instagram.
Social links will open in a seperate tab so the user doesnt loose track of where they were on the website.

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the C.V. option to download if need be.

# Further Testing
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung Note 20, Samsung 20Fe.
Tests work done on each link to make sure they were linking correctly.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. - They commented that the layout could be better on the about page in smaller resolutions.

## Known Bugs
On some mobile devices the text on the Landing page is out of alignment due to font size..
A white gap can be seen under Hero image.
On about page the text elongates and buttons are pushed together.
