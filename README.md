# Milestone Project - Portfolio Website
View the live project here.[https://github.com/SafUmmSul91/Like_I_Said_Try_Again.git]

This is a Portfolio website I created for my Milestone Project with Code Institute. It is mostly responsive and easy to navigate on different devices.

I created this README.md file using the Code Institute template.

# User Experience (UX)
## User stories
### First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the person the portfolio belongs to, and to be able to navigate through the site to find the content I may need e.g testimonials, social media links, past and upcoming projects.
Returning Visitor Goals
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the person with any questions I may have.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.
Frequent User Goals
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added projects or updates.

# Design
Colour Scheme

The "Brand" Colours I chose are:
*RICH BLACK FOGRA 29 #071013
*SILVER SAND #B8C0CA
*PEWTER BLUE #75ABBC
*PALE PINK #FAD4D8

and where found using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
I chose these colours because I thought them modern and fun espcially paired with the font.

# Typography

I chose [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?preview.text=The%20quick%20fox%20jumped%20over%20the%20lazy%20brown%20dog.&preview.text_type=custom&category=Serif,Sans+Serif&sort=popularity) and [Jura](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jura?preview.text=The%20quick%20fox%20jumped%20over%20the%20lazy%20brown%20dog.&preview.text_type=custom&category=Serif,Sans+Serif&sort=popularity) 

Monterrat being used for the main body of text and Jura used for Headings, Subheadings, these two fonts were chosen because they are clean and modern and switch up the monotony. They are also easy to read. Sans Serif will be the fallback font in casse they aren't being imported correctly.

# Imagery

I didn't use much imigary in this project, it is quite minimal and straight forward.
The Here Image is the SRM logo that I created using [camva](https://canva.com) it is simple but effective.
The Avatar of the woman in headscarf I also found on [canva](https://canva.com) and edited it to suit the colour scheme.
